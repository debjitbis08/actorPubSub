{"name":"Actor PubSub","tagline":"A publish/subscribe library for JavaScript based on Actor Model.","body":"# ActorPubSub [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/debjitbis08/actorPubSub.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/debjitbis08/actorPubSub)\r\n\r\nActorPubSub is a dependency free publish/subscribe library for JavaScript based on the Actor Model. It takes a lot of \r\ninspiration from [PubSubJS](https://github.com/mroderick/PubSubJS) and uses the ideas from \r\n[Actors Make Better Observers](http://www.dalnefre.com/wp/2011/05/actors-make-better-observers/) to implement the \r\nrequired actors. It can be used as a normal pub/sub library as all the actor logic is hidden away.\r\n\r\nA major benefit of this implementation is that no observer list updates block the notification process.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Dependency free.\r\n* Synchronization decoupling.\r\n* Attaching and detaching subscribers is also asynchronous.\r\n* Since observer list updates are asynchronous, notify operations are possible while updates are in progress.\r\n* Data passed to subscribers is a copy of the original data, thus, changes to it by the subscribers does not \r\n  affect other subscribers and the publisher.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
